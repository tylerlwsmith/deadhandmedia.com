A month into the COVID-19 pandemic, I had some time on my hands and started experimenting with web animation. I threw together 58 lines of HTML/CSS/JS and tweeted a video of what I built, which became the [only viral tweet I've ever had](https://twitter.com/tylerlwsmith/status/1252026273007677441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1252026273007677441%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.1.135%3A1313%2Fprojects%2Fsmiley-face-animation%2F). The animation was silly and the code was a little hacky, but it still makes me smile.
