Stan Lee's Hands of Respect was the first website that I ever built. The iconic comic book author created Hands of Respect late in his life to combat [what he saw as a lack of respect and solidarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su6VnUEjne0) during increasingly uncertain times.

When I became a web developer, one of my former professors put me in touch with the person that Stan Lee had tasked with running Hands of Respect. The organization was receptive to a design refresh on their existing website. I designed and developed a new site, and its launch coincided with a Facebook livestream event that Lee hosted to promote the organization.

The website was taken down in 2022.
