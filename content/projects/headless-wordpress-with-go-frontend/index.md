**This project was a huge mistake.** I built this as a relatively new Go programmer, thinking I could build a blog faster and get more experience with Go if I built a Go front-end for headless WordPress via the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/). Instead, I ran into every sharp edge of WordPress. I completed the project for the sake of finishing it, but I certainly wouldn't recommend using this.

Despite the idea being terrible, I'm happy with how it turned out. I this project was my first opportunity to use Go's concurrency primitives and JSON deserialization, and the design looked clean.
