I built [caddyexamples.com](https://caddyexamples.com/) as a reference for the common configurations I use in my own Caddy-powered projects. [Caddy Server](https://caddyserver.com/) was a major quality-of-life improvement over NGINX, but it's official documentation lacked practical configuration examples. While this site contains less than a dozen pages, the concepts contained within it cover over 90% of my day-to-day Caddy configuration needs.
