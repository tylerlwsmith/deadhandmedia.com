This Ansible Playbook is used to configure a local development environment on a desktop Linux machine. It installs Node.js, VS Code & extensions, Docker, and common command line applications.

I built this Playbook in 2021 when I was frequently nuking-and-paving Linux VMs that I used for local development.
