**Hi there, I'm Tyler** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer that specializes in web application development. I've built projects using a wide array of technologies that includes Django, Express.js, Ruby on Rails, Vue and WordPress, but my most frequently used tools are Laravel and React. For a full overview of my experience, you can check out my [resume](https://raspberrytyler.com).

I get pretty excited about code and technology, which is why I've been writing on my dev.to blog for about three years.

My [GitHub](https://github.com/tylerlwsmith) profile is a little sparse right now, but I'm starting to open source some of my personal projects.
